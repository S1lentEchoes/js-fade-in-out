# fade-in-out

A simple fade in or out function for controlling, or animating, an element's CSS opacity setting.

As I stated in all my other repositories - The first thing that you will probably notice is that it is HEAVILY commented. This was intentional (yes, even to this extreme degree), mostly just for myself. I am still fairly new to coding, and multiple times in the past when I have gone back to some of my previous work I would always have a hard time understanding what my code meant. So along with relentlessly detailing everything that I was doing in the code, I also tried to capture the mindset that I had while I was coding it (or rather, why I coded it the way that I did).

This also has the added benefit of helping to remember this information without the need for comments - sort of like when you write something down to remember it, and the act of writing it down is what helped you remember it. With the only downside being the time taken to write the comments (since minifying removes all of the extraneous content), I saw no reason not to.

This code should easily be self-explanatory, and I am sure that there is a million and 1 of copies (either exactly alike or very similar) of this function out there.  Still I thought it prudent to keep a respository here for safe keeping.  I had wanted to integrate this functionality into my css-animation function (which can be found at - https://github.com/S1lentEchoes/css-animation ) after it was created since that function was made specifically for extensibility/reusability.  But since adding floating point numbers is a pain, and adding an extra operator (to divide by 10, after the counter/value increase) seemed to add more complexity than was worth it, I decided on just keeping this function.

Adding the functionality into css-animation would still result in less code overall, but keeping these separate also keeps both of these functions simple and concise.  Still, I may end up integrating this funcionality into css-animation in the future and if I do then I will still keep this function as an alternate version.

I think that about covers it, any more code explanations that may be needed can easily be found inside the file's comments. I have included both the normal version, and the minified version.
